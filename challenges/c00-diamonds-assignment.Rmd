*Purpose*: Throughout this course, you'll complete a large number of *exercises* and *challenges*. Exercises are meant to introduce content with easy-to-solve problems, while challenges are meant to make you think more deeply about and apply the content. The challenges will start out highly-scaffolded, and become progressively open-ended.

In this challenge, you will go through the process of exploring, documenting, and sharing an analysis of a dataset. We will use these skills again and again in each challenge.

# Grading Rubric
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Effort | Some task __q__'s left unattempted | All task __q__'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations | Documented observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not supported by analysis | All observations supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Team
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Documented | No team contributions to Wiki | Team contributed to Wiki |
| Referenced | No team references in Wiki | At least one reference in Wiki to member report(s) |
| Relevant | References unrelated to assertion, or difficult to find related analysis based on reference text | Reference text clearly points to relevant analysis |

## Due Date
<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due on the day of the class discussion of that exercise. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJTh2DH8nVJd2eyMMoyNGroReo0BKcJrz1eONi3rPSc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Data Exploration
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this first stage, you will explore the `diamonds` dataset and document your observations.

__q1__ Create a plot of `price` vs `carat` of the `diamonds` dataset below. Document your observations from the visual.

*Hint*: We learned how to do this in `e-vis00-basics`!

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Plot `price` vs `carat` below
## Your code here!
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

**Observations**:

- Price and carat are correlated. Diamonds are more likely to be just over 1, 1.5, 2 or 2.5 carats than just under those values. Data is generally hard to see

__q2__ Create a visualization showing variables `carat`, `price`, and `cut` simultaneously. Experiment with which variable you assign to which aesthetic (`x`, `y`, etc.) to find an effective visual.

```{r q2-task}
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below
## Your code here!
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut))
```

```{r q2-taskb}
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below
## Your code here!
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = carat))
```

**My silly way of cutting the data**
```{r q2-taskc}
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below
## Your code here!
diamonds_ideal <- diamonds %>%
  #as_tibble() %>%
  filter(
    cut == "Ideal"
  )

#diamonds_ideal
diamonds_premium <- diamonds %>%
  #as_tibble() %>%
  filter(
    cut == "Premium"
  )

diamonds_very_good <- diamonds %>%
  #as_tibble() %>%
  filter(
    cut == "Very Good"
  )

diamonds_good <- diamonds %>%
  #as_tibble() %>%
  filter(
    cut == "Good"
  )

diamonds_fair <- diamonds %>%
  #as_tibble() %>%
  filter(
    cut == "Fair"
  )

ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(data = diamonds_ideal, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), color = "red") +
  geom_smooth(data = diamonds_premium, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), color = "yellow") +
  geom_smooth(data = diamonds_very_good, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), color = "green") +
  geom_smooth(data = diamonds_good, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(data = diamonds_fair, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), color = "black") +
scale_fill_discrete(name="Cut",
                         breaks = c("ctrl", "trt1", "trt2"),
                         labels = c("Control", "Treatment 1", "Treatment 2"))
```
Where Red is "Ideal", Yellow is "Premium", Green is "Very Good", Blue is "Good" and Black is "Fair".


**Observations**:

- diamond price increases mostly with carat.
- Seems to be a secondary effect of cut on price.
- Larger diamonds do not have nice cuts.


# Communication
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this next stage, you will render your data exploration, push it to GitHub to share with others, and link your observations within our [Data Science Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki).

__q3__ *Knit* your document in order to create a report.

You can do this by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of your document in RStudio.

![Terminal](./images/c00-knit.png)

This will create a local `.md` file, and RStudio will automatically open a preview window so you can view your knitted document.

__q4__ *Push* your knitted document to GitHub.

![Terminal](./images/c00-unstaged.png)

You will need to stage both the `.md` file, as well as the `_files` folder. Note that the `_files` folder, when staged, will expand to include all the files under that directory.

![Terminal](./images/c00-staged.png)

__q5__ *Document* your findings in our [Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki). Work with your learning team to come to consensus on your findings.

The [Datasets](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Datasets) page contains lists all the datasets we've analyzed together.

__q6__ *Prepare* to present your team's findings!

__q7__ Add a link to your personal data-science repository on the [Repositories](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Repositories) page. Make sure to file it under your team name!
